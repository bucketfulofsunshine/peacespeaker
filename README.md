# PEACESPEAKER, THE ANTI-VIOLENCE SWORD

Embark on a short quest featuring a sentient scimitar, an apprentice who's in ***way*** over her head, & a grumpy Cowled Wizard. 

This mod was created as a semi tongue-in-cheek contribution (anti-violence weapon) to the BG Modding Month contest. 

## FAQ

### Q: Where can I start the quest?

A: Explore Waukeen's Promenade after escaping Irenicus' Dungeon. If you leave the Promenade before speaking with the Twitchy Cowled One, then the quest cannot be started. 

### Q: Will this be TRA-ified?

A: I have no plans for it at present. If someone is interested in translating, reach out to me on Discord (bucketfulofsunshine). Otherwise the mod will remain in its current form (outside of bug fixes).

### Q: How do I report bugs or suggest improvements?

A: This is my first released quest mod. I've no doubt many inconsistencies and bugs are present. Please contact me and I'll fix things up (with credit & thanks). <3


## CHANGELOG

* 2.0 - Small bug fixes, custom BAMs (thank you Zen <3) & a third option to report to Inspector Brega & bring the Cowled Wizard mentor to justice. 

## LICENSING

* My mod is open source. That means anyone is free to fork, make pull requests or alter content. While I'd prefer people approach me if they want new content (e.g. commentary to vanilla quests), crossmod is free real estate.

## SPECIAL THANKS

* *Zenblack* - who is a wizard in his own right & kindly made custom BAMs for the mod. 

* *Kantz* + *Niewiem* for keeping copies of my old mods & sending them my way - allowing me to reupload my older stuff. 

* The usual suspects. Wes Weimer for *Weidu* & Argent77 for *Near Infinity* + *WeiDU Notepad++ Highlighters*.
