# Peacespeaker, the Anti-Violence Sword (For BG2EE or EET)

Embark on a short quest featuring a sentient scimitar, an apprentice who's in ***way*** over her head, & a grumpy Cowled Wizard. 

This mod was created as a semiâ€“tongue-in-cheek contribution (an anti-violence weapon) to the BG Modding Month contest.

**V2.2 adds** 

- A talking weapon (scimitar).
- A short quest, with three different solutions, to solve the weapon's dilemma (or choose to ignore it altogether - your choice). 

## FAQ

### Q: Where can I start the quest?

A: Explore Waukeen's Promenade after escaping Irenicus' Dungeon. Speak to the Twitchy Cowled One before leaving or the quest cannot be started. 

### Q: How do I report bugs or suggest improvements?

A: This is my first released (small & short) quest mod. Please contact me if you find any bugs & I'll fix them up (with credit / thanks). <3
