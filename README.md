# PEACESPEAKER, THE ANTI-VIOLENCE SWORD

Embark on a short quest featuring a sentient scimitar, an apprentice who's in ***way*** over her head, & a grumpy Cowled Wizard. 

This mod was created as a semiâ€“tongue-in-cheek contribution (an anti-violence weapon) to the BG Modding Month contest.

## FAQ

### Q: Where can I start the quest?

A: Explore Waukeen's Promenade after escaping Irenicus' Dungeon. If you leave the Promenade before speaking with the Twitchy Cowled One, then the quest cannot be started. 

### Q: How do I report bugs or suggest improvements?

A: This is my first released (small & short) quest mod, so I've no doubt there are inconsistencies & bugs lurking. Please contact me & I'll fix things up (with credit / thanks). <3

## CHANGELOG

* 2.1 - Fully traified (thanks Royal), added Spanish translation (ditto), fixed small visual glitch on BAMs. 

## LICENSING

* This mod is open source. That means anyone is free to fork, make pull requests, etc. While I'd prefer people approach me if they want new content (e.g. changing what I've written), crossmod is free real estate.

## SPECIAL THANKS

* *RoyalProtector* for traifying the mod & adding the spanish translation. Then, as always, for cleaning up my code. <3 

* *Zenblack* - who is a wizard in his own right & kindly made custom BAMs for the mod.

* A big thank you to *Kantz* & *Niewiem* for saving my older files & sending them back my way so I could reuploaded them.

* The usual suspects. Wes Weimer for *Weidu* & Argent77 for *Near Infinity* + *WeiDU Notepad++ Highlighters*.
